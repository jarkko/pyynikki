* Removed l10n-simplified (actually only moved it to tmp/not-needed). 
  In the original version (commit 026a150) the specs were failing because of 
  l10n problems (e.g. 'expected: "15,2 km", got: "15.2 km"', 
  see tmp/docs/failing-spec-even-in-original), so even the l10n-simplified
  plugin was not a cure. Since the new I18n module seems to provide
  everything which l10n provided, I moved it out of the way.
  
  The problem with both l10n and I18n is that they don't automatically
  localize numbers. The only solution I found is to change the "15.2"
  in the specs to "15,2".
  
  Further testing of the localization will be with webrat.
