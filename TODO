 * make the rkov script into a rake task
 * validations in Runner: run, name, sex, because RunObserver calls
   runner.age_class_with_gender(run.event.event_date)
 * validations into the migration files
 * what if a Run has "time3600" and "time11200", but no "time7600"?
 * age_class is computed or given?
 * event.story is never used?
 * someday remove db/migrate/add_sample_data
 * enable to change locale
 * delete tmp/l10n when sure that it's not needed
 * application.rb#set_locale, possible double submitting bug?
